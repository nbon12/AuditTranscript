Response not needed anytime soon:\n1) Why was `make collect-static` necessary to run the sources app locally? Before running that command, anything on port 4000 was returning Error 404. I noticed it created some untracked files in my local repo:\n```\nkoku/static/openapi.532dfaae7187.json\n\tkoku/static/openapi.532dfaae7187.json.gz\n\tkoku/static/openapi.json\n\tkoku/static/openapi.json.gz\n\tkoku/static/rest_framework/\n\tkoku/static/staticfiles.json\n```\nWhen should I update/delete these files? Are you locally ignoring them in your global .gitignore?",
